# gLog

Your silver bullet logging solution. Because that is definitely what
the world needed: another logging library.

## Features

gLog supports the following features:

- log-levels 
- smart-colors
- customization
- caller-insertion
- multiple outputs
- log rotation
- panic-handling
- conditionals:
	- output per logging level
	- caller from a certain level
- sane defaults

#### coming soon™:

- "plug-n-play" log formats

## Output

The output follows this structure:

``` %level:\t%time – %caller – … ```

`%level` is coloured by  default when logging  to stdout  or stderr.
It  can be enabled and disabled at will.

`%time` is in the ISO-8601 format working with nanosecond precision
(if supported)

`%caller` is the  name  (format:  `package.function`)  of  the
function that is logging the message.  By default, this does not
happen for `INFO` and `WARNING`.

### Why `–` and not `-`

I  decided  to  use  [U+2013](https://codepoints.net/U+2013)  (EN
DASH)  over a normal [U+002D](https://codepoints.net/U+002D)
(HYPHEN-MINUS)  due  to multiple reasons; some of which are:

- `2D` is not at all unlikely to appear in a log-message
- they look very similar while they can still be distinguished
- it is also in most fonts used in a terminal
	- if it is not in your's think about changing fonts
- it allows for easy splitting and processing of logs with tools like
  `cut` or `awk`
- you don't have to type it by hand anyway

## Levels

| Level   | Description                                                       |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TRACE   | Print *everything*. This is usually not wanted unless debugging.  |
| DEBUG   | Print *every* function call.                                      |
| INFO    | Print general status messages like HTTP-Requests (a good default) |
| WARNING | Handled errors. (the better default¹)                             |
| ERROR   | Non-Critical Errors like access denied                            |
| FATAL   | Errors that do not allow the Program to continue                  |

¹) "no news is good news" or so they say

## Notes

- Obviously, setting a low loglevel will slow down your program, as
  the writing is not buffered and getting the caller is relatively
  expensive
	- using StdOut/StdErr for logging decreases this time because
	  it does not need to write to disk
